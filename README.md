# Asset-Allocation
To calculate an ideal asset allocation

I am an individual investor and a Popular Investor on eToro.
I invest mainly in technology and want to learn more about coding to understand better.
I have learnt some basic Python from Skillshare and use Python3 IDLE to code.
As a practice, I am coding my algorithm to determine the ideal allocation and purchase price of stocks.
